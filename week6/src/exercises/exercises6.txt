**** Exercises week 6 ***

Exercise 1 and 3 will prepare for lab 4.
Ex 3 is time consuming, prioritize lab 4 if new to programming.

Exercise 2 (theory) is important **WILL** show up on exam!

Exercises
---------

1.  See ex1inheritance. Implement classes Vehicle, Car and Van to make program TestCarVan print the below.
    You should use inheritance and override the toString() method. All data should be set in constructors.
    All data should be private. If reasonable use abstract class(es). There should be NO redundant code.

    Description of classes:
    - A Car has an id, a top speed and an owner (a Person).
    - A Van has an owner (a Person), a max cargo and an id.

    A run of the program:

    Car{topSpeed=160.0{owner=Person{id='123', name='olle'}, id='abc'}}
    Van{maxCargo=400.0{owner=Person{id='456', name='fia'}, id='def'}}
    Car{topSpeed=210.0{owner=Person{id='456', name='fia'}, id='ghi'}}
    Van{maxCargo=800.0{owner=Person{id='123', name='olle'}, id='jkl'}}

    TIP: Possible for IntelliJ to generate constructors and toString()
