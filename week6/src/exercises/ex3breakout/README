*** Info for the Breakout game ***

1.  Inspect and run samples/catchtherain (run file CatchTheRainGUI)

2.  Do some research, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)
    Try some instance of the game (should be possible to find on the Web)
    We will make simplest possible variation of the game.

3.  Implement classes Ball, Paddle, Brick and Wall. There should be no redundant code. If so
    use abstract base classes. To be able to render them they must implement IPositionable.

    TIP: Use upper left cornar for x and y position
    TIP: Use dx and dy foor speed. If dx = dy = 0 object is idle.

5. Create the model in BreakoutGUI method init();

6. Make something show up on screen (no movement for now).

7. Start trying to move the ball.

8. Add collision detection.

9. Etc. until works.
